# facts-dnn-training

A repository to train and optimize a neural network implementation of a component of FACTS (https://github.com/kwangsk/FACTS), a model of speech motor control, using the Maeda model of the vocal tract (https://github.com/sensein/VocalTractModels). This model has not yet been published due to occasionally causing instability when implemented in the larger FACTS model.
